I'm building a website


I recently hired a designer to do some illustrations, and the illustrations came out great, but I overestimated my ability to take those illustrations and create a good design around them. I've been trying to copy my way into a good design, but it hasn't been going well.

I need someone to do some web designs. I want to do a flat price and not by the hour. I'm looking for a quote that you think is a slight overestimation of how long you believe you think this may take. I'm looking for a designer who feels their skills and style will make this an easy project. I'm afraid I don't want to give you a challenging project, I just need someone with the skills, good eye, and good taste to make my site presentable and help people take it seriously.

I need designs both for the full desktop sizes and for mobile (I can do the intermediate sizes by extrapolating from what you've already done).

These pages need to be done:

- Homepage
- Sign Up page
- "feature" essay page (there will be several feature essays, but they can have the same design)
- normal essay/content page
- about us

I want the designs to be stylistically flat and minimal. I don't want any animations included in the designs (although you may feel free to suggest some and show external examples). I am a developer, and I'll be implementing these designs myself, so I also want them in a form that is friendly to developers. In the past I've been given designs in invision and zeplin, and for my purposes that's good enough, I just need to be able to inspect the exact colors, fonts, sizes, etc.

I'm quite happy with the illustrations I've already commissioned, and I don't need any more illustrations. However, many of the designs I like have subtle svg's or interesting backgrounds, and I would like that sort of thing, as long as the interesting backgrounds are simple and stay in scope.

I'd also very much appreciate a

Here's the terrible product I've managed to figure out so far:

I'm showing you what I have so far just to give you an idea of the information I'm trying to present, and I don't want what I've already done to too tightly limit what you would come up with. I just share it so that you know all the things that have to be present.

Here's the original pitch I did for the illustrations. I hope it will help you understand what I was going for and give context about my wishes.

In terms of style and feel, I want this site to have a light-hearted feeling, as if the site is a breath of fresh air. This is a site that hopes to change the world, and the audience I'm hoping to reach are intellectuals and knowledge workers, especially technical people at first. I want them to feel that this site is clean and excellent, and that they can trust whoever's behind it to do big important and moral things.

Here are some pages on interfaces.pro that I feel particularly capture what I'm hoping for. A clean, airy, minimal design is what attracts me. There's only one important caveat: this idea isn't some typical VC funded startup that's hoping to capture a niche and become a unicorn. This idea is equal parts web product and a living essay about an activist mission. I'm genuinely trying to change things in our world, so there's a very strong social/political angle. I'm not sure how that truth should come across in the design, but I do know that I don't want it to have the same cutesy marketing tone as many of the sites I'm about to show you ha.
