Hello! I'm building a website, and I need some web design work to make the project polished and professional.

Here's what's happened so far: I recently hired an illustrator to do some illustrations, and they came out great, but I overestimated my ability to take those illustrations and create a good web design around them. I've been trying to imitate other sites to create a good design, but it hasn't been going well.

I just need someone to take what I already have, and take the concept/general layout, and make an actually great design.

I'm looking for a quote that you think is a slight overestimation of how long you believe this may take, and I'm looking to pay a flat price rather than by the hour. You probably should first give just a quick ballpark estimate to see if we're even in the same range, and then we can be more exact once you've had time to look it over more carefully.

I'm looking for a designer whose skills and style will make this an easy project, so be honest about if this is a project you feel is in your strong area. I'm afraid this won't be a very interesting or challenging project, I just need someone with the skills, good eye, and good taste to make my site look great and help people take it seriously.

Here's what I have so far:

https://crowdsell.io

It's frankly awful, I'm *not* a skilled designer at all, and even from a content perspective it's very incomplete. I'm still working on many aspects, including the copy and essays. I'm only showing you this to give you an idea what I'm shooting for from the perspective of the content and the general layout. Please as you begin to imagine what you would do, don't be too caught up in what I've done, simply use it as a jumping off point to understand what I'm hoping to achieve.

I need designs both for the full desktop sizes and for mobile (I can do the intermediate sizes by extrapolating from what you've already done). Here's a listing of all the pages I need:

- [Homepage](https://crowdsell.io)
- [Sign Up page](https://crowdsell.io/sign-up)
- "Feature" essay pages. There are several of these, they are more important essays, but will only differ by the illustrations they have in the header.
	- [The Failure of Intellectual Property](https://crowdsell.io/why-we-need-it)
	- [How Could Crowdsell Change Society?](https://crowdsell.io/the-mission)
	- [How Does Crowdsell Work Exactly?](https://crowdsell.io/how-it-works)
- [Normal essay/content page](https://crowdsell.io/who-is-crowdsell-for) (there will be many of these).

I want the designs to be stylistically flat and minimal. I don't want any animations included in the designs (although you may feel free to suggest some and show external examples).

It's also important to me that the designs have a cohesive vertical rhythm. I typically prefer larger fonts ([here's a type-scale that I threw together that I like](https://type-scale.com/?size=26&scale=1.333&text=A%20Visual%20Type%20Scale&font=Poppins&fontweight=400&bodyfont=Poppins&bodyfontweight=400&lineheight=1.45&backgroundcolor=white&fontcolor=%23333&preview=false)), but that's only a preference and I don't want to hamper whatever work you would do.

I am a developer, and I'll be implementing these designs myself, so I also want them in a form that is friendly to developers. In the past I've been given designs in invision and zeplin, and for my purposes that's good enough, I just need to be able to inspect the exact colors, fonts, sizes, etc. If you know of a tool that's more developer friendly than those, I'd be thrilled to use it with you. Having raw svg's and pdf's would also be nice.

I'm quite happy with the illustrations I've already commissioned, and I don't need any more illustrations. However you can feel free to fiddle with the existing illustrations, or to tell me to change the colors (I've set the current colors with css). Also, many of the designs I like have subtle background svg's, and I would like you to include that sort of thing as long as they are simple and stay in the project scope.

Here's the original brief I made for the illustrations. I hope it will help you understand what I was going for and give context about my wishes.

In terms of style and feel, I want this site to have a light-hearted feeling, as if the site is a breath of fresh air. This is a site that hopes to change the world, and the audience I'm hoping to reach are intellectuals and knowledge workers, especially technical people at first. I want them to feel that this site is clean and excellent, and that they can trust whoever's behind it to do big, important, and moral things.

Here are some pages on `interfaces.pro` that I feel particularly capture what I'm hoping for. A clean, airy, minimal design is what attracts me.

As I share these `interfaces.pro` pages, there's only one important caveat I want to give you: my idea isn't some typical VC funded startup that's hoping to capture a niche and become a unicorn. My idea is equal parts web product and a living essay about an activist mission. I'm genuinely trying to change things in our world, so there's a very strong social/political angle. It's difficult for me to articulate exactly how this activist quality should change the designs you do, but I do know that I don't want it to have the same cutesy marketing tone as many of those above sites. Many modern websites have a patronizing tone, and come off to me as inauthentic because they're only trying to build a profitable company, but are pretending to care deeply about some social mission. Just keep that in mind as you begin to think about this project, but remember that I'm not even entirely sure what the consequences of this caveat are ha, so don't worry too much about it.
