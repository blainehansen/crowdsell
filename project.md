People need to be able to create projects, upload "demo" material of any kind, accept many potentially small payments that are charged immediately and held in escrow, and paid to them after the project is funded.

Once the project goes through, the information is released into the world with a permissive open culture license of some kind.
If it's code it could be released onto a git repo hub
If it's just files it could just be served on crowd sell
All files will be seeded for torrenting by crowd sell


The funding going through should be contingent on some sort of sanity check by the group
