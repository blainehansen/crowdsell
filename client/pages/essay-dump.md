#### The reversal of Corporatism and Consolidation, and the uncoupling of thought work from production.


We have a theory that one of the main reasons corporations have been able to amass so much power and control, is because of intellectual property (physical property is important too, we'll get to that in a second). Since profiting from intellectual labor has always required so much more than just the ability to do the intellectual labor (legal teams to acquire patents and enforce non-infringement, operations teams to build and operate factories and supply chains, marketing teams to sell all the copies of the work), that means that the only groups who have been regularly capable of incentivizing intellectual labor was large corporations.

Crowdsell could change that. Since intellectual labor is directly supported and made completely available, that means many small teams and organizations can build on each other, combine as needed, and emergently do the same work as large corporations. We imagine a world where these small teams are always forming and disbanding and moving around in a fluid way, quickly making progress on important problems without being limited by the four walls of the company they're working in.


So then how will

#### Democratic Ownership of Factories and Farms and Everything Else.

And now to the second reason corporations have consolidated, *physical* property.


If you have all these small intellectual teams moving around and creating valuable thought work, who is


Right now there aren't many practical ways for communities to own and operate something simply to provide a benefit to that community. For example, it would be difficult to effectively run a farming cooperative that provides an entire large urban area with food, or a factory to produce things like solar panels or medication.

Government is one way, but it's slow and heavy and prone to corruption and abuse. Publicly traded corporations are another, but they slowly succumb to greed and exploitative practices (since the "public" who owns them is usually not actually that public). Non-profit organizations are another, but they typically have a hard time out-competing for-profit organizations, since very few people are actively working on building systems that make it more efficient and effective to run a non-profit.

Non-profits often also have a hazy contribution, something that's difficult for the supporters to quantify and understand. That leads many to not trust that non-profits are effective.

A Crowdsell campaign on the other hand has very clear expectations, and the community can be sure that they're really getting something of promised value.

//- Companies are only ever going to figure out how to run companies better to maximize profits, they're not going to figure out how The Everyone can run something better for The Everyone. Crowdsell makes this possible.


We imagine a world where the physical things that make the bedrock of the economy, like farms, factories, mines, utilties


Crowdsell creates the possibility of a perfect fusion between profit and non-profit motives. Small thought work companies can do work that improves the ability for non-profits to operate (whether it be software systems, or research about organizational techniques), and then those non-profits can use that thought work freely after interested communities have rewarded the thought workers.


This model is potentially transformative. It makes it possible for the only for-profit entities that exist to be crowdselling ones, ones that produce thought work that can be openly used by the rest of society, which operates physical factories and organizations in a democratic way. We can almost think of this like an economy with two sectors, one focused on research and the other focused on fulfillment.

#### Better incentives for environmental research and development.


Right now, if a group of researchers wanted to support themselves by coming up with better designs for something like solar panels, they would not only have to do the actual research, but form a company capable of doing the expensive and time-consuming patent application process, the legal team to prosecute patent infringement, and creating manufacturing models and putting together a whole labor force of factory workers and sales-people and all the business development people, etc.


Then that company would be the only one who could produce those superior panels, without paying a hefty licensing fee, which means that their production is tethered to the business acumen and standards of this one company. Then all those panels will be sold with whatever large markup those companies feel they can get away with that justifies their massive investment. All of these layers of restriction and unnecessary waste create a system with a high amount of friction, where doing the research and getting that research out to the whole world is slowed down many times for no other reason than that our society has fooled itself into thinking you can own ideas.

Compare that to something for which the patent has *expired*, like a generic brand medication. There are many medications like acetaminophen and ibuprofen you can get for tiny amounts of money (just what it takes to produce and distribute them), which has made their spread through society rapid.

And think if there were people who could benefit by coming up with freely available ways to improve even those already inexpensive manufacturing systems?


That's the only intelligent portion of patent law, the fact that the patents expire and become the public domain after twenty years. But twenty years is too long, and Crowdsell makes it possible to remove that wait and get the same benefits.

#### Better Government.


It's very difficult for people to improve their governments, both because the governments themselves slowly evolve to insulate the powerful, but also because no one is actively doing the difficult research to

#### Cheaper and more available... everything.


Since so much of our existing techological innovation, from electronics to medical equipment to pharmaceuticals to solar panels, all rely on the coercive and restrictive system of patents and copyrights, huge amounts of important and valuable technological progress is made artificially more expensive and unavailable. People die every year because a handful of companies own the "right" to produce and sell these things.

Crowdsell makes it possible for the researchers and engineers who develop these technologies to be directly rewarded by the communities who need them, allowing those technologies to be produced and distributed for nothing more than the cost to make them. They could even be produced and distributed by the democratically owned means mentioned earlier.

We strongly recommend you make your licenses "share-alike". To understand why, imagine you've created some short stories, featuring some completely original characters.

Then some hypothetical "big evil corporation" (let's give it a competely fictional name, like the Bizney Corporation), comes along. They realize that your characters are completely free for commercial use (as they should be), but they decide they're going to create a saga of movies featuring your characters, but license them in the old draconian and controlling way. Of course, they can't take the characters away from the world (your license prevents that), but they *can* lock up any story they tell, and all their specific interpretive details will now be closed off and vulnerable to expensive lawsuits by their team of legal assassins. There are some corporations who have actually done things like this, taking stories in the public domain (various fairy tales, probably ones you've never heard of), telling their own specific versions of them, and then aggressively prosecuting anyone else who uses those public domain stories in a way that's close enough to get away with.

We believe that sort of behavior should simply not be allowed under any circumstances, and by making your license a share-alike, you ensure that those kinds of abusive practices will have no leg to stand on. If someone wants to use your work, they have to make it as open as you have, and are free to financially support themselves in the process.
