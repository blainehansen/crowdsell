	h3 Experimenting with more complex funding formats, like "hold-out" amounts or monthly backing.


	h3 Making Crowdsell a completely decentralized service.

	p Decentralization is one of the key philosophies behind open source and crowdsell, and we want to push the whole idea into alignment with our greatest goals. Making crowdsell decentralized is also important to allow the idea to be taken seriously as a new way to fundamentally think about organizing society.

If it's decentralized though, then it will belong to the community to govern, and so it can be a reflection of our values.
