	h2 Crowdsell can be used for any creative work that exists primarily as information.

	p We thought we'd give a longer list of concrete examples to get everyone's imaginations working.

	p Potential examples include:

	ul
		li Open Source Software Libraries. Software already has a strong open source tradition, but we hope for this Crowdsell model to supercharge open source and make it the norm. Anything software can do could be made available to the world, all the way from new relational databases to decentralized protocols.

		li Artistic works like Film, Music, Digital Art, Books, or Video Games.

		li Apps for Desktop, Mobile, or even the Browser.

		li
			| Basic Research or more "technical" books. Obviously research that is funded with public money
			a(href="https://paywallthemovie.com/") should be available to the public
			| , but the Crowdsell model could fill in the gaps to make other types of research openly available while still being properly compensated.

		li Designs for physical objects, like new solar panels, phones, cars, even recipes for food or products like shampoo.

		li Books or studies documenting new processes or techniques, like business management strategies or a new construction method.

		li
			a(href="http://www.openlawlab.com/2014/08/05/githubbing-law/") Open Source Legal Contracts and Documents

	h3 And anything else you can imagine!

	p Any useful intellectual labor can find a way to fit into this Crowdsell model. If you can come up with some preview materials and promises that properly show to the world what the work is and why it's special, it can be offered on Crowdsell, spurring the advancement of society.

	//- 		b Example: An Open Source Software Library
	//- 	p The preview material might be snippets and examples of how the code works, the full guide or manual for the code, and again the suite of unit tests.
	//- 	p The promises could again be a description of the file tree, and a guarantee that the unit tests pass, and all the code in the guide and api documentation lines up.
