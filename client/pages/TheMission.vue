		| Society?

	p Crowdsell is based on one very powerful idea:

	h2 All thought work should be open and freely available to the world.

	p This is to allow humanity to rapidly learn and improve itself.

	p And in order to accomplish this goal, we need to give open thought work, and the communities who need it, a practial economic engine to propel it forward.

	p This economic engine will place the importance and value of thought work at the top of humanity's priorities, and change our economy to focus on teaching people how to produce valuable thought work, and reward those people for what they do.

	//- ul
	//- 	li Every piece of intellectual labor is open to the world, in whatever way it's possible and useful.

	//- 	li Collaborative, democratic, or even holocratic means of owning and managing public goods are made practical. We don't want centralized services or organizations to be able to control so many people in such important ways, so we have to give those decentralized and publicly owned systems a way of effectively out-competing centralized ones. We believe that in order for that to happen, we have to create a practical and sustainable economic engine to power a open culture world.

	//- 	li We believe the people who actually do the valuable work of innovating and improving society should be easily able to have prosperous and comfortable lives, without having to compromise their integrity or sell themselves.

	//- 	li We want to remove large numbers of middle-men and rent-seekers from the economy, by directly connecting innovation and the public awareness together, rather than trap innovation in organizations that also have to provide manufacturing or shipping.

	h2 So what concrete changes might this philosophy create?

	p
		| It's obviously impossible to predict the future, but here are some of the things we believe Crowdsell makes possible in the world. We think the changes could be massive, and we invite you to use your imagination about what this could bring, and we're sure we haven't thought of everything. And some of these things might not happen, but we're going to actively work to
		i make them happen
		| .

	h3 A Decentralized Internet and Universally Open Source Software.

	p It is uncontroversial to say that people are growing unsatisfied with the centralized nature of the internet, and with the behavior of the tech giants.
	p Crowdsell creates a simple economic model for people to create new systems that replace the old centralized services with open source systems, ones that don't need to harvest data or manipulate people to make money in advertising-based models.

	h3 Democratic Ownership of Factories and Farms and Everything Else.

	p Right now there aren't many practical ways for communities to own and operate something simply to provide a benefit to that community. Government is one way, but it's slow and heavy and prone to corruption and abuse. Publicly traded corporations are another, but they slowly succomb to greed and exploitative practices (since the "public" who owns them is usually not actually that public). Non-profit organizations are another, but they typically have a hard time out-competing for-profit organizations, since very few people are actively working on building systems that make it more efficient and effective to run a non-profit.
	p Non-profits often also have a hazy contribution, something that's difficult for the supporters to quantify and understand. That leads many to not trust that non-profits are effective.
	p A Crowdsell campaign on the other hand has very clear expectations, and the community can be sure that they're really getting something of promised value.

	p Crowdsell creates the possibility of a perfect fusion between profit and non-profit motives. Small thought work companies can do work that improves the ability for non-profits to operate (whether it be software systems, or research about organizational techniques), and then those non-profits can use that thought work freely after interested communities have rewarded the thought workers.

	p This model is potentially transformative. It makes it possible for the only for-profit entities that exist to be crowdselling ones, ones that produce thought work that can be openly used by the rest of society, which operates physical factories and organizations in a democratic way. We can almost think of this like an economy with two sectors, one focused on research and the other focused on fulfillment.

	h3 Better incentives for environmental research and development.

	p Right now, if a group of researchers wanted to support themselves by coming up with better designs for something like solar panels, they would not only have to do the actual research, but form a company capable of doing the expensive and time-consuming patent application process, the legal team to prosecute patent infringement, and creating manufacturing models and putting together a whole labor force of factory workers and sales-people and all the business development people, etc.

	p Then that company would be the only one who could produce those superior panels, without paying a hefty licensing fee, which means that their production is tethered to the business acumen and standards of this one company. Then all those panels will be sold with whatever large markup those companies feel they can get away with that justifies their massive investment. All of these layers of restriction and unnecessary waste create a system with a high amount of friction, where doing the research and getting that research out to the whole world is slowed down many times for no other reason than that our society has fooled itself into thinking you can own ideas.

	p
		| Compare that to something for which the patent has
		i expired
		| , like a generic brand medication. There are many medications like acetaminophen and ibuprofen you can get for tiny amounts of money (just what it takes to produce and distribute them), which has made their spread through society rapid.

	p And think if there were people who could benefit by coming up with freely available ways to improve even those already inexpensive manufacturing systems?

	p That's the only intelligent portion of patent law, the fact that the patents expire and become the public domain after twenty years. But twenty years is too long, and Crowdsell makes it possible to remove that wait and get the same benefits.

	h3 Better Government.

	p It's very difficult for people to improve their governments, both because the governments themselves slowly evolve to insulate the powerful, but also because no one is actively doing the difficult research to

	h3 Cheaper and more available... everything.

	p Since so much of our existing techological innovation, from electronics to medical equipment to pharmaceuticals to solar panels, all rely on the coercive and restrictive system of patents and copyrights, huge amounts of important and valuable technological progress is made artificially more expensive and unavailable. People die every year because a handful of companies own the "right" to produce and sell these things.
	p Crowdsell makes it possible for the researchers and engineers who develop these technologies to be directly rewarded by the communities who need them, allowing those technologies to be produced and distributed for nothing more than the cost to make them. They could even be produced and distributed by the democratically owned means mentioned earlier.


	//- hopes that this can make forms of cooperativism and socialism practical and non-coercive
	h3 A less polarized world.
	//- this provides incentives for people to do good work that people find valuable, and not create unethical systems that trap people in echo chambers and push people apart from each other
	//- in an open culture world, communities have a way to reward people who build things that improve those communities, which dismantles incentives to create things that exploit them.

	h3 Ethical and Pro-Human AI and Automation.

	p Our world is currently on a dangerous path, one where a small number of very wealthy companies and individuals are pushing forward AI technology to further solidify their manipulative business practices. Similarly, automation technologies, while having decreased the cost of many things substantially, have done so at the cost of communities, and the benefits of this improved efficiency often accrue at the top layer of the economy.
	p AI and automation technologies have the potential to solve a massive number of human problems, and could usher in an era of true post-scarcity prosperity for everyone. But that will only be the case if those technologies are democratically owned, and managed in a way that prioritizes the well-being of everyone, rather than the oligarchal few. Both the thought work itself and the places that thought work is deployed must be owned by the people, or we're doomed to a world of technological feudalism.

	h3 Technology that helps improve real life, rather than replacing it.

	p One of the consequences of a centralized internet where data harvesting and advertising are at the center of the economic model, is that all these services have a vested interest in maximizing the amount of time people spend on a platform. More data, more attention, more time lost, are all goals of these platforms. This has created an industry that actively uses psychological manipulation techniques and encourages addiction and dysfunction, all in the pursuit of "engagement". Huge numbers of people are now isolated, lonely, and unable to focus and enjoy real life.
	p Crowdsell makes possible a world where thought workers can make technologies that provide some concrete value, and then get out of the way. Since communities choose and support projects with conscious choices rather than subconscious habits, those technologies can be built with real life at the center of their design, and don't have to resort to manipulation.
