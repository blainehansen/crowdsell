	p Crowdsell is based on one very powerful idea:

	h2 All thought work should be open and freely available to the world.

	p This is because:

	h2 The problems of our world are only getting more complex and difficult. We need to work together to solve them.

	p And in order to make this happen:

	h2 We need to give open thought work, and the communities who need it, a practial economic engine to propel it forward.

	p Crowdsell is a model that gives the entire world community the same economic powers as a person or a company. It can own property, since any open culture thought work is the property of the whole world. And it can pay people to work on its behalf, because anyone who works on a Crowdsell project is working on behalf of everyone. This means that the entire world community is no longer voiceless and

	//- p This economic engine will place the importance and value of thought work at the top of humanity's priorities, and change our economy to focus on teaching people how to produce valuable thought work, and reward those people for what they do.

	h3 So what might the concrete changes be?

	p
		| We've built Crowdsell because we sensed a difference between what the world is, and what the world could be. Here's some descriptions of what the world could be. It won't happen all at once, and it will take many of us working with our whole minds and focus, but we believe it can be done. In the words of

	h4 A Decentralized Internet and Universally Open Source Software.

	p It is uncontroversial to say that people are growing unsatisfied with the centralized nature of the internet, and with the behavior of the tech giants.
	p Crowdsell creates a simple economic model for people to create new systems that replace the old centralized services with open source systems, ones that don't need to harvest data or manipulate people to make money in advertising-based models.
	p In such an open source world, maybe we can build systems that reward honesty, quality, and consistency, rather than sensationalism and noise. Then perhaps we can put our society back together, and heal the polarization these echo chambers have created.


	h4 Technology that improves real life, rather than replacing it.

	p One of the consequences of a centralized internet where data harvesting and advertising are at the center of the economic model, is that all these services have a vested interest in maximizing the amount of time people spend on their platform. More data, more attention, more time lost, are all goals rather than design flaws. This has created an industry that actively uses psychological manipulation techniques and encourages addiction and dysfunction, all in the pursuit of "engagement." Huge numbers of people are now isolated, lonely, unfocused, and unable to enjoy real life.
	p Crowdsell makes it economically practical to create technologies that provide some real human value, and then get out of the way. Since communities choose and support projects with conscious choices rather than subconscious habits, those technologies can be built with real life at the center of their design, and don't have to resort to manipulation.


	h4 Ethical and Pro-Human AI and Automation.

	p Our world is currently on a dangerous path, one where a small number of very wealthy companies and individuals are pushing forward AI technology to further solidify their manipulative business practices. Similarly, automation technologies, while having decreased the cost of many things, have done so at the cost of communities, and the profits of this improved efficiency often only go to the already wealthy.
	p AI and automation technologies have the potential to solve a number of massive human problems, and could usher in an era of true post-scarcity prosperity for everyone. But that will only be the case if those technologies are democratically owned, and managed in a way that prioritizes the well-being of everyone, rather than the oligarchal few. Both the thought work itself and the ways that thought work is deployed must be owned by the people, or we're doomed to a world of technological feudalism.


	h4 Anything that's possible in a world where open thought work is the norm, can now be achieved.

	p There are many effects Crowdsell could have on the world. We have many more ideas about what it could do, like repair our outdated education systems, dramatically improve government, and even reverse our culture of corporatism and consolidation. But these ideas are complex and speculative and deserve entire essays all by themselves.
