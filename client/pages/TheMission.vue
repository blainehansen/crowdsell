	h2 This is about the long term goals of crowdsell

	//- the fact that crowdsell will eventually become decentralized, once that's a practical and safe choice.

	//- plans to add crowdfunding investment

	//- plans to add more complex but useful systems, like "hold-out" amounts or ongoing contributions


	//- hopes for this idea to take over manufacturing, architecture, scientific research, designs for hardware things

	//- systems for decentralized organization and coordination

	//- hopes that this can make forms of cooperativism and socialism practical and non-coercive



	//- plans to add torrent hosting
