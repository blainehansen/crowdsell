				h1 Who Is Crowdsell For?

				p Crowdsell can be used for any creative work that exists primarily as information.

				p It's especially useful for anyone who doesn't want to create a pointless controlling company to make a living creating things in the common interest.

		p We thought we'd give a longer list of concrete examples to get everyone's imaginations working.

		p Potential examples include:

		ul
			li Open Source Software Libraries. Software already has a strong open source tradition, but we hope for this Crowdsell model to supercharge open source and make it the norm. Anything software can do could be made available to the world, all the way from new relational databases to decentralized protocols.

			li Artistic works like Film, Music, Digital Art, Books, or Video Games.

			li Apps for Desktop, Mobile, or even the Browser.

			li
				| Basic Research or more "technical" books. Obviously research that is funded with public money
				out-link(href="https://paywallthemovie.com/") should be available to the public
				| , but the Crowdsell model could fill in the gaps to make other types of research openly available while still being properly compensated.

			li Textbooks and educational materials of any kind.

			li Designs for physical objects, like new solar panels, phones, cars, even recipes for food or products like shampoo.

			li Books or studies documenting new processes or techniques, like a business management strategy, a manufacturing process, or a new construction method.

			li

		h3 And anything else you can imagine!

			h3 Budget and Reward

			p It is uncontroversial to say that people are growing unsatisfied with the centralized nature of the internet, and with the behavior of the tech giants.
			p Crowdsell creates a simple economic model for people to create new systems that replace the old centralized services with open source systems, ones that don't need to harvest data or manipulate people to make money in advertising-based models.
			p In such an open source world, maybe we can build systems that reward honesty, quality, and consistency, rather than sensationalism and noise. Then perhaps we can put our society back together, and heal the polarization the twenty-four hour news cycle and social media echo chambers have created.

		p Any useful intellectual labor can find a way to fit into this Crowdsell model. If you can come up with some preview materials and promises that properly show to the world what the work is and why it's special, it can be offered on Crowdsell, spurring the advancement of society.

		//- 	p The promises could again be a description of the file tree, and a guarantee that the unit tests pass, and all the code in the guide and api documentation lines up.
