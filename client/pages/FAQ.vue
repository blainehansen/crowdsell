	//- I have some creative work I've already finished. Can I still use crowdsell?
	//- absolutely, in fact that was the entire original concept. When you're putting together your project, make the proof of concept some preview of your work, make the promises a list of things that are already true about it, and make the monthly and upfront budget all $0. Then people will simply be raising whatever reward amount you choose, and the release and voting process will happen immediately once you're funded.

	//- you say all thought work should be freely available. do you think people shouldn't get any credit?
	//- no, but we think having the right to *ownership* is different than having the right to *authorship*

	//- why is crowdsell a centralized service?

	//- why isn't crowdsell open source?

	//- does crowdsell host a torrentable version of the projects?

	//- why does crowdsell only charge 2%?

	//- can I do investment crowdfunding on Crowdsell?

	//- is Crowdsell a venture backed company?

	//- does Crowdsell have any plans to do ongoing support or patronage?

	//- does Crowdsell store credit cards and passwords safely?

	//- how does Crowdsell handle voting?

	//- how does Crowdsell handle fraudulent projects?

	//- why are there blind periods?

	//- why aren't there rewards?

	//- why am I charged right away?

	//- how might this effect the existing open source world? will it harm it?
	//- maybe, but we think not
	//- this empowers small teams to make money on open source work in a way that they couldn't before
	//- a lot of existing open source work is either by companies who try to upsell things into consulting or premium versions
	//- or by large companies who want to manage reputation and gain mindshare,
	//- or by any company that wants their open source work to be vetted and improved by the community
	//- we think all of those will stick around in some form

	//- why am I charged for credit card fees?
	//- to encourage you to use a fee-less payment method
	//- to make everyone aware of what a scam credit card fees are
	//- to ensure the creators reliably get the entire goal they asked for
