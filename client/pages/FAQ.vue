	//- a lot of existing open source work is either by companies who try to upsell things into consulting or premium versions
	//- or by large companies who want to manage reputation and gain mindshare,
	//- or by any company that wants their open source work to be vetted and improved by the community
	//- we think all of those will stick around in some form
