#why-is-crowdsell-different

	p
		| Crowdsell has a few very important differences with other crowdfunding systems. Those differences are intentional, because Crowdsell is designed to add
		i promises and guarantees
		| to the process of crowdfunding, and the projects
		i are expected to be finished
		| . This different philosophy made different features necessary, and here's a list of them.


	h3 There aren't "rewards"

	p
		| Basically all crowdfunding sites have some concept of "rewards", or things that the backers receive to thank them for contributing. We will always encourage creators to put some acknowledgement of their backers into the work itself, and Crowdsell will always post (optionally anonymous) lists of who contributed and how much, but we don't have a system for anything beyond that.
	p
		| Although we are considering adding a more typical rewards system, we'll tell you our philsophy for why we've decided not to for now, and how that philosophy would influence how we
		i would
		| make a rewards system.

	p It all comes down to a few ideas:

	ul
		li
			b The work is enough.
			| We believe that people have been selling intellectual labor short. If someone does the hard work to create a new musical album, or a software library, or a set of modular architectural designs, those are valuable contributions to society. We think rewarding people for that work is all we need to do.

		li
			b We want creators to focus on the work, not the trinkets of the work.
			| If someone is good at writing software, or innovative open source legal contracts, should we really expect them to also be good at designing t-shirts or stickers? Should we expect them to divert their time and creative energy away from making incredible intellectual contributions? We don't think so.

		li
			b We want every valuable project, not just the ones with flashy rewards.
			| We want to level the playing field between creators. Someone's contributions should be measured based on how valuable they are to the backers, not based on how clever the rewards are. We've seen an arms race develop on other crowdfunding sites between projects that have venture capital behind them that can afford lavish marketing budgets and logo designs etc, and those that are the products of individuals or small teams who have something valuable to give, but can't afford to make some noise. We want to simplify this, and get everyone focusing back on what matters: the work.


	p If we do add a rewards system, it will have these important features:

	ul
		li
			b Crowdsell will simplify and automate the process.
			| We want creators to focus on what they're good at and what matters: the creative work they do. So, Crowdsell will over time find types of rewards where all the creator has to do is provide some assets like designs or source, and the process of actually making and fulfilling them can be handled entirely by Crowdsell.
			| So for example, if we learn that t-shirts and stickers are things that backers love, or if they love tickets to project celebration parties, or if they love
			a(href="https://craigmod.com/journal/digital_physical/") beautiful books that document the project's creation
			| , we'll find ways to make offering those rewards simple and automated for the creator, while still being delightful for backers. We'll find partners to provide them at reasonable prices, build features into the site that make pricing and offering those rewards simple, and ensure that the whole thing allows the creator to focus on what they do best.
			| This simplification and streamlining will also mean that all projects and creators will have the same opportunities to offer rewards, so the thing that will make a project stand out will be the creative work itself, just as it should be.

		li
			b Rewards will be priced to contribute to the project, not to buy a thing.
			| To echo the last point, backers on crowdsell aren't buying rewards, they're buying the thought work. We want to shift the discussion in crowdfunding away from a project being a "pre-order" or simply a shop for people to buy things, and towards a method where the
			i thought work
			| is itself what people are excited about. That means that when someone pledges, their money is mostly going to the creator, not to a manufacturing company that makes t-shirts. The pledge amounts will reflect this.

		li
			b Rewards will only be available during the Blind Period.
			| The Blind Period is basically an analog to the entire campaigns of other crowdfunding sites. It's the time when the excitement of a deadline and the fleeting opportunity to participate in a once-in-a-lifetime event can energize a community, and get them excited to show the creator exactly how special their work is. That means the Blind Period has to be different, a little special, so it will be the only time to get rewards. After the Blind Period, everyone is just working towards getting to the goal so that the project will be released.


	h3 Money is charged upfront, rather than simply promised

	p
		| On other crowdfunding sites, the backers are charged
		i at the end
		| of the campaign, which means that
		a(href="https://www.backerkit.com/blog/dealing-with-failed-payments/") some percentage of the charges will fail
		| . This is actually pretty reasonable, since those campaigns aren't guaranteed to successfully reach their funding amount and actually result in the project happening. On Crowdsell though, the project being offered is expected to be already done, and the project will have as much time as necessary to reach its goal. The creators can even choose to accept the currently raised amount at any time and close the project. The only circumstances where the creators
		i won't
		| be given the money is if the project never reaches its goal and the creators never accept the current amount, or if it does reach the goal but turns out to have broken the promises it made. Both of these we hope will be very very rare.

	p Since Crowdsell is designed to add rigor and dependability to the process of crowdfunding, we also wanted to give creators a guarantee that the entire goal amount they set will be raised. If the backers can expect guarantees, so can the creators.

	//- This is different from other crowdfunding systems where they simply "promise" to pay once the campaign is successful. This ensures that some percentage of the raised money isn't lost due to failed charges. We thought this was reasonable, since on Crowdsell the work is already expected to be finished, the creator has pledged to release the work, and they've made promises about it. When someone pledges on Crowdsell, the only scenario their money won't be given to the creator is if the project
		i never
		| reaches its goal, or if it does reach the goal but turns out to have broken the promises it made. Both of these we hope will be very very rare.


	h3 Creators make promises and guarantees

	p
		| Again echoing the idea of rigor and dependability, every project has a list of promises and guarantees that it makes about the work being offered. This is necessary since the work is being kept a secret during the campaign, these promises and the preview material are the only way the backers can have a clear idea of exactly what they're buying. It also ensures that someone doesn't just
		a(href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/01/prodeum-scam-cryptocurrency-for-produce-disappears.html") invent some exciting idea and then disappear with the raised money
		| .

	p
		| This whole idea of guarantees makes it possible for an entire community of excited people to safely participate in bringing something amazing into the world. You don't have to know or trust the creator of a project, you just have to be excited about what they've built and the promises they've made about it.

	p
		| It also means that anyone, even if they don't have any existing media exposure or an established community or credentials, can create projects and be measured simply by the quality of the work they product. It even means that someone could create a project and put it forward
		i anonymously
		| , and that anonymity wouldn't need to set off any red flags of fraud or abuse.


	h3 Projects can take as long as they need

	p One question people may ask is why someone should pledge money to a project themselves rather than just waiting for others to do it. While this is true (and the "Bystander Effect" is well documented in psychology), it's also true that the project will simply continue to not be released if everyone doesn't reach the goal! Since some projects might be a bit ahead of their time, or be large projects with large goals that might take a while to gather enough people to support, we thought it would be a good idea to allow these projects some breathing room to do the hard work of persuading the world their project is a good idea.

	p Crowdsell is designed to restore what we call "the buyer's imperative" to intellectual property. When you want a physical object the person selling that physical object can restrict your access to it until you pay them for creating and bringing it to you.

	p Our society has had a difficult time applying this idea to intellectual property though, even before the digital age, and the only frankly terrible solution we've come up with is intellectual property law. We think the Crowdsell method of simply not releasing the work to the world in any form before the creators have been compensated for it is the only way you could ever apply the buyer's imperative to intellectual property, since the only way to truly control information is to keep it a true secret for a time.


	h3 Projects have a "Blind Period"

	p The Blind Period is designed to protect creators from being too modest about what they've produced. If their work is a genuinely amazing contribution to society, and many people are thrilled for it to exist, the campaign ought to represent that enthusiasm, no matter what amount the creators ask for.

	//- This is so that if a creator underestimates how much excitement and willingness to contribute to a project there is, they will still get to benefit from that excitement, and use the money raised for future pursuits. We didn't want people to miss out on the opportunity to be rewarded properly for work that people are very willing to pay for. The creator can decide when setting up the project how long they want this period to be. Creators will be encouraged to offer some special recognition to those who contributed during the blind period.

	p Anyone who contributes during the Blind Period will get special recognition in the backer lists as well as being the only ones who can receive rewards once rewards are introduced. This gives the community a reason to contribute even if their contribution is above and beyond the amount the creators asked for.
