#why-we-need-it

	//- intellectual property doesn't empower creators, it empowers publishers
	//- it forces the organizational coupling of creativity and manufacturing and legal enforcement

	//- it slows down innovation and creativity

	//- it encourages companies to create "walled gardens" and to trap people in their systems
	//- it encourages centralization and control

	//- it encourages inefficient service models

	//- it encourages "walling off the commons"

	//- it allows large companies to prevent access to life-saving medicine and processes that could drastically improve society
