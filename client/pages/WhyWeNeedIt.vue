		TheFailureOfIntellectualProperty

	.page-container

		p
			| In the United States, the basis of intellectual property law is the&nbsp;
			out-link(href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Clause") copyright clause of the U.S. Constitution
			| . That clause was drafted with good intentions, to "promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts." And it's difficult to argue that if thought workers had no economic support or incentive to pursue intellectual labor, they either wouldn't be motivated to, or they wouldn't be able to.

		p
			| But there's a very large difference between&nbsp;
			i no system
			| &nbsp;for supporting intellectual labor, and&nbsp;
			i any system
			| . We believe the system that has developed over history to gain almost worldwide adoption, is not only a terrible system for actually supporting and promoting progress, but is actively harmful&nbsp;
			i
				| when compared with a&nbsp;
				b good
				| &nbsp;system

		p We believe that saying our current intellectual property laws are an effective way to promote creation is a lot like saying a bucket of acid on someone is an effective way to help someone who's on fire. Yes it's technically true that the fire has been put out, but now an unnecessary onslaught of different, painful problems has been created.

		p We believe there are many problems with intellectual property, and we'll give some of them here.

		p This is a big topic, so we will certainly have much more to say in the future. Join the mailing list to receive any future essays or updates from us, and to ask for an invitation to the private beta.

		h3 Intellectual Property prevents access to crucial technologies.

		p This effect can be seen in many industries, from electronics to automobiles to energy, but an obvious example is the medical industry.

		p Pharmaceutical companies have come under deserved criticism for&nbsp;
			out-link(href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/25/high-drug-prices-caused-by-us-patent-system.html") artificially jacking up drug prices
			| &nbsp;and&nbsp;
			out-link(href="http://www.i-mak.org/overpatented-overpriced-excessive-pharmaceutical-patenting-extending-monopolies-driving-drug-prices/") gaming the patent system to extend their monopoly periods
			| .

		p Many crucial technologies, from electronics to medical equipment to solar panels, are today controlled by patents and copyrights. Because of this, these technologies are made artificially much more expensive and unavailable, rather than being widely deployed to solve pressing social problems. People die every day because we hand these technologies over to the whims of whatever corporation was first able to secure and enforce a patent.

		p Imagine if these technologies were instead completely open and available to be improved on and used in whatever ways the whole world needed, and the thinkers who produced them had been rewarded in a less restrictive way. We would obviously be living in a better world.

		h3 Intellectual Property slows continued progress.

		p
			| Patents often&nbsp;
			out-link(href="https://www.the-scientist.com/bio-business/do-patents-promote-or-stall-innovation-33443") stop researchers and engineers
			| &nbsp;from pursuing ideas or using certain methods. It is obvious that limiting these thinkers from doing valuable work that they would otherwise do is counterproductive and slows down society as a whole.

		p
			| Twenty years is the typical patent duration in the United States, and thanks to the&nbsp;
			out-link(href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Term_Extension_Act") Mickey Mouse Protection Act of 1998,
			| &nbsp;copyrighted works take somewhere around&nbsp;
			i 120 years
			| &nbsp;to enter the public domain. In the world of science and technology, twenty years is an eternity, and 120 years is just as good as eternity for a mortal human being.

		p Do we want to live in a society that has a twenty or 120 year lag in progress? Are we okay with throttling the rate at which our society and culture are advanced and enriched? In which the critical work of building and connecting ideas is artificially stopped? We certainly don't.

		//- they claim that the protections enable scientists to work on these areas because it protects the economic incentive, but they're comparing the current brutally inefficient and restrictive system to *no system*.
		//- raising a crowdsell campaign will have the same effect as filing a patent or a copyright, because it places the idea in the world in a way that still allows you to benefit from it
		//- when someone is looking to compete with you, they have to convince the entire world *not* to support your crowdsell and instead support theirs, which means they have to be legitimately better able to deliver on the promises.
		//- and the existence of the crowdsell tells people what they shouldn't bother working on, because it's already being handled. this allows them to clearly just transition to something else, or do *further* research that builds on yours (which they're now legally allowed to do because you didn't pointlessly lock up the innovation)

		//- p Creators make promises about their work, standards that is has to live up to, and backers will vote to decide if it does.
		//- p This removes a lot of risk from crowdfunding, and makes it possible for less known creators to make bold ideas happen.

		//- p Crowdsell is a viable alternative to patent and copyright, since anything "secret" about the work can be hidden until a campaign has reached its financial goal.
		//- p The combination of previews, promises, and the voting system, make it possible for creators to sell to the entire world all at once.


		h3 Intellectual Property is coercive, corruptible, and wasteful.

		//- it's coercive, which means that it's less about who has useful contributions and more about who can work the system
		//- it's coercive because whoever gains the monopoly can charge anything they want, rather than being subject to market pressures.

		//- it's corruptible because it's mediated by a single entity and institution. that means that success in the system relies more on who understands and can work the system than anything else.
		//- this means that large corporations are much more suited to this environment, since they're the only ones that have the legal weight to attack and defend in court, and can simply acquire patent portfolios and shore up their control without contributing much.

		//- it's wasteful because all these people who don't contribute ideas but who do contribute legal and corporate maneuvering profit rather than the thinkers.
		//- it's wasteful because we get all this litigation and fear rather than people moving quickly to do the important work.


		//- if someone takes something away from you that you created, you won't want to make things. patents may give the single entity some sort of incentive to innovate, but it closes down everyone else's.
		//- and patents don't really give you an incentive to innovate, they give you an incentive to acquire patents. once you have the patent, you can rest on your coercive monopoly and stop innovating, safe in the knowledge that anyone who tries to improve on your patent can be legally destroyed.
		//- we're living with a system of state mandated coercion, in which you are required to coerce or be coerced in turn.

		//- all of these properties of intellectual property revolve around the fact that it's coercive.
		//- it wouldn't be corruptible if the system was itself subject to competition and replacement, rather than mandated by force.
		//- and all these middlemen wouldn't be able to find a position anywhere if there wasn't a corruptible system to hijack.


		p
			| Markets aren't perfect, but this is a system where the cost of providing a good or service is based on coercion instead of merit. Rather than the price being subject to some sort of market pressures and over time rewarding merit, prices are instead dictated by the coercion's maximum ability to extract. Prescription medications are often not priced according to how difficult it was to come up with the medication, or to manufacture and distribute it, but instead according to the&nbsp;
			out-link(href="") curve maximum
			| &nbsp;reflecting how much people are willing to die. As a medication becomes too expensive, we will be forced to allow more people to die, and the total number of people able to pay will decrease. This isn't an efficient market where a product's price gradually approaches it's cost to produce and distribute (as any commodity does and should), but one where some optimal point where people are still willing to pay in order to not die has to be discovered.


		p
			| This&nbsp;
			out-link(href="http://www.i-mak.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/i-mak.enbrel.report-2018-11-30F.pdf") I-MAK study
			| &nbsp;shows some of the results of the Amgen corporation using loopholes and over-patenting on the Enbrel arthritis medication. The costs to society and individuals have been massive, but what's particularly striking was how easy it was for this company to exploit the patent system and gain monopoly status for so much longer than usual.

		p These sorts of stories aren't unique, and over-patenting has become fairly easy.

		p One of the fundamental weaknesses of the patent system is that it requires us to create a coercive system that must be mediated by a single entity, the government. Especially since governments around the world have more and more fallen out of their citizens' control, it presents a very concerning problem.

		p Crowdsell brings the price of innovation back into the realm of reasonable markets. In the current system, companies can charge whatever is most profitable for them, rather than whatever is profitable based on market conditions. Since it's a coercive system, whoever gets to the patents first and has the legal firepower to defend them can charge literally any price they want, without any regard for what a market would say.

		p
			| The real problem with the lottery ticket effect is that&nbsp;
			i it was created by the patent system, and isn't a natural effect
			| . Essentially lottery tickets are the result of a coercive system that allows companies to extort the world for access to important technology. That's actually one of the problems this idea solves. Creators can still become wealthy, but not "obscenely" wealthy. And it's important to point out that the people getting obscenely wealthy were rarely the creators themselves, but the executives and capital owners who didn't add any real value to the process, but merely had the shrewdness to acquire the right patents at the right times, often by buying other companies. Once they had exercised this legal shrewdness (which relied more heavily on existing access to resources and positioning rather than actual cleverness), they had acquired a legal right to coerce people, that didn't have any relationship to the difficulty of producing the work.

		p One of the things that mitigates this is that patentability requirements aren't important anymore. That means that&nbsp;
			i any
			| &nbsp;useful work you can contribute to the world can be rewarded. That means that some individual idea doesn't have to carry you into wealth, but rather many improvements and further applications of the same idea over time can have the same effect.



		//- intellectual property doesn't empower creators, it empowers publishers
		//- it forces the organizational coupling of creativity and manufacturing and legal enforcement


		h3 Intellectual Property is unnecessary. Now a new model exists.

		p If a system can be invented that has all the benefits of an old system and none if its downsides, it's easy to say that the old system should be abandoned in favor of the new one.

		p We believe Crowdsell is such a system:

		p
			b All the Benefits:

			ul
				li
					i Rewards creators for valuable intellectual labor?
					| &nbsp;Check.
				li
					i Requires creators to share their insights with the world?
					| &nbsp;Check. This is a basic assumption of the Crowdsell model, that the compensation is only in return for open culture access. And very importantly, that open culture access begins&nbsp;
					i immediately
					| , rather than with decades of delay.
				li
					i Protects creators from theft and plagiarism?
					| &nbsp;Check. If a creator has had some insight they need to keep secret before they are compensated, the system of previews and promises allows them to show only the unsensitive portion of their work and make statements about why it is useful. This protects both them and the backers. And in the event that there isn't some secret but they're worried about not receiving due credit when the idea is discussed in the future, the&nbsp;
					out-link(href="") creative commons attribution requirement
					| &nbsp;protects them as well. Those creative commons licenses do rely on existing copyright law to be effective, but even in a world without copyright law, a concept of&nbsp;
					router-link(to="/authorship-not-ownership") authorship rather than ownership
					| &nbsp;could protect their rights with a much lighter legal framework.


				//- we actually think the secret portion is less likely to be important. Real good ideas often only come from the adjacent possible, and can usually only actually be produced by people with special skills and a deep understanding of a particular area.

				//- https://medium.com/key-lessons-from-books/the-key-lessons-from-where-good-ideas-come-from-by-steven-johnson-1798e11becdb

			b None of the Problems:

			ul
				li
					i Prevents Access?

				li
					i Possible to Manipulate?

					p Since we've removed coercion from the process, we can instead rely on much simpler and more justifiable rights, like the rights to not be assaulted or stolen from (no one is allowed to hack us to get the information), and the right not to be defrauded (no one can lie and say they created something when in fact someone else did).

					p Removing the coercion removes the ability for people who add no value to profit. Merely understanding the legal machinery or having access to the capital and opportunity to buy patent portfolios isn't enough, you actually have to do work of value. Since crowdsell lets the world decide, and makes the process free and open, these coercive systems can't be gamed.

				li
					i Favors the Rich and Powerful?

				li
					i Slows Innovation and Progress?

				li
					i Encourages Litigation?
					| &nbsp;One of the most encouraging things about this idea is that&nbsp;
					i multiple different creators can benefit from the same idea
					| . Since each of them merely has to have some distinctive contribution to make, and ask for an amount the world thinks is worthwhile, all of them can have success. It's just up to the world to decide.


				li
					i Encourages Walling of the Commons?

		//- h3 On the Subject of "Lottery Ticket" inventions.

		//- p Creators should set their reward amounts higher than they probably think



		//- the intellectual property system applies to everyone, whether they agree to participate or not. If someone has a patent, they can use legal force to extract damges or apply injuctions. The consiequenes of this are that profiting from intellectual property is less a matter of contributing valuable intellectual work than having the means to maneuver the intellectual property sytem itself. This kind of phenomenon is a well stuided idea in econmics, called rent seeking, where middlemen who add no value to society are able to coopt a coercive system for their own purposes.
