	p
		| In the United States, the basis of intellectual property law is the
		a(href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Clause") copyright clause of the U.S. Constitution
		| . That clause was drafted with good intentions, to "promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts," which is an uncontroversially positive thing to do. And it's difficult to argue that if thought workers have no economic support or incentive to pursue intellectual labor, they either won't, or they won't be able to.

	p
		| But there's a very large difference between
		i no system
		| for supporting intellectual labor, and
		i any system
		| . We believe the system that has over history come to be the dominant one enacted by most countries, is not only a terrible system for actually supporting and promoting progress, but is actively harmful
		i
			| when compared with a
			b good
			| system

	p Many believe that intellectual property law exists

	//- they claim that the protections enable scientists to work on these areas because it protects the economic incentive, but they're comparing the current brutally inefficient and restrictive system to *no system*.
	//- raising a crowdsell campaign will have the same effect as filing a patent or a copyright, because it places the idea in the world in a way that still allows you to benefit from it
	//- when someone is looking to compete with you, they have to convince the entire world *not* to support your crowdsell and instead support theirs, which means they have to be legitimately better able to deliver on the promises.
	//- and the existence of the crowdsell tells people what they shouldn't bother working on, because it's already being handled. this allows them to clearly just transition to something else, or do *further* research that builds on yours (which they're now legally allowed to do because you didn't pointlessly lock up the innovation)


	//- p Creators make promises about their work, standards that is has to live up to, and backers will vote to decide if it does.
	//- p This removes a lot of risk from crowdfunding, and makes it possible for less known creators to make bold ideas happen.

	//- p Crowdsell is a viable alternative to patent and copyright, since anything "secret" about the work can be hidden until a campaign has reached its financial goal.
	//- p The combination of previews, promises, and the voting system, make it possible for creators to sell to the entire world all at once.



	//- everyone's so blindly adherent to the current way we think about organizing this kind of work, that no one is even slightly stopping to consider what *other* methods could achieve the same results without all these negative consequences

	//- intellectual property doesn't empower creators, it empowers publishers
	//- it forces the organizational coupling of creativity and manufacturing and legal enforcement

	//- it slows down innovation and creativity

	//- it encourages companies to create "walled gardens" and to trap people in their systems
	//- it encourages centralization and control

	//- it encourages inefficient service models

	//- it encourages "walling off the commons"

	//- it allows large companies to prevent access to life-saving medicine and processes that could drastically improve society
	p Since so much of our existing techological innovation, from electronics to medical equipment to pharmaceuticals to solar panels, all rely on the coercive and restrictive system of patents and copyrights, huge amounts of important and valuable technological progress is made artificially more expensive and unavailable. People die every year because a handful of companies own the "right" to produce and sell these things.
