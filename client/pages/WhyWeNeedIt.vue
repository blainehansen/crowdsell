		| The Failure
		br
		| of Intellectual
		br
		| Property

	p
		| In the United States, the basis of intellectual property law is the
		out-link(href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Clause") copyright clause of the U.S. Constitution
		| . That clause was drafted with good intentions, to "promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts," which is an uncontroversially positive goal. And it's difficult to argue that if thought workers had no economic support or incentive to pursue intellectual labor, they either wouldn't be motivated to, or they wouldn't be able to.

	p
		| But there's a very large difference between
		i no system
		| for supporting intellectual labor, and
		i any system
		| . We believe the system that has developed over history to gain almost worldwide adoption, is not only a terrible system for actually supporting and promoting progress, but is actively harmful
		i
			| when compared with a
			b good
			| system

	p We believe that saying our current intellectual property laws are an effective way to promote creation is a lot like saying pouring a bucket of acid on someone is an effective way to help them when they're on fire. Yes it's technically true that the fire has been put out, but now an unnecessary onslaught of different, painful problems has been created.

	p We believe there are many problems with intellectual property, and we'll give some of them here.

	p This is a big topic, so we will certainly have much more to say in the future. Join the mailing list to receive any future essays or updates from us, and if you'd like to, to ask for an invitation to the private beta.


	h3 Intellectual Property prevents access to crucial technologies.

	p This effect can be seen in many industries, from electronics to automobiles to energy, but an obvious example is the medical industry.

	p Pharmaceutical companies have come under deserved criticism for
		out-link(href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/25/high-drug-prices-caused-by-us-patent-system.html") artificially jacking up drug prices
		| and
		out-link(href="http://www.i-mak.org/overpatented-overpriced-excessive-pharmaceutical-patenting-extending-monopolies-driving-drug-prices/") gaming the patent system to extend their monopoly periods
		| .

	p Since so much of our existing techological innovation, from electronics to medical equipment to pharmaceuticals to solar panels, all rely on the coercive and restrictive system of patents and copyrights, huge amounts of important and valuable technological progress is made artificially more expensive and unavailable. People die every year because a handful of companies own the "right" to produce and sell these things.
	p In our current system, almost all technological innovation relies on

	p This means that important technologies are made artificially much more expensive, making their spread and adoption through society much slower. And some technologies never see the light of day, because

	//- https://www.the-scientist.com/bio-business/do-patents-promote-or-stall-innovation-33443
	//- they claim that the protections enable scientists to work on these areas because it protects the economic incentive, but they're comparing the current brutally inefficient and restrictive system to *no system*.
	//- raising a crowdsell campaign will have the same effect as filing a patent or a copyright, because it places the idea in the world in a way that still allows you to benefit from it
	//- when someone is looking to compete with you, they have to convince the entire world *not* to support your crowdsell and instead support theirs, which means they have to be legitimately better able to deliver on the promises.
	//- and the existence of the crowdsell tells people what they shouldn't bother working on, because it's already being handled. this allows them to clearly just transition to something else, or do *further* research that builds on yours (which they're now legally allowed to do because you didn't pointlessly lock up the innovation)

	//- p Creators make promises about their work, standards that is has to live up to, and backers will vote to decide if it does.
	//- p This removes a lot of risk from crowdfunding, and makes it possible for less known creators to make bold ideas happen.

	//- p Crowdsell is a viable alternative to patent and copyright, since anything "secret" about the work can be hidden until a campaign has reached its financial goal.
	//- p The combination of previews, promises, and the voting system, make it possible for creators to sell to the entire world all at once.




	//- everyone's so blindly adherent to the current way we think about organizing this kind of work, that no one is even slightly stopping to consider what *other* methods could achieve the same results without all these negative consequences

	//- intellectual property doesn't empower creators, it empowers publishers
	//- it forces the organizational coupling of creativity and manufacturing and legal enforcement

	//- it slows down innovation and creativity

	//- it encourages companies to create "walled gardens" and to trap people in their systems
	//- it encourages centralization and control

	//- it encourages inefficient service models

	//- it encourages "walling off the commons"

	h3 Intellectual Property creates a system of coercion.

	p Markets aren't perfect, but this is a system where the cost of providing a good or service has a coercive quality, since rather than the price being subject to some sorts of market pressures and over time rewarding merit, prices are instead dictated by the coercion's maximum ability to extract. A prescription medications are often not priced according to how difficult it was to come up with the medication, or to manufacture and distribute it, but instead according to the
		out-link(href="") curve maximum
		| reflecting how much people are willing to die. As a medication becomes too expensive, we will be forced to allow more people to die, and the total number of people able to pay will decrease. This isn't an efficient market where a product's price gradually approaches it's cost to produce and distribute (as any commodity does and should), but one where some optimal point where people are still willing to pay in order to not die has to be discovered.

	h3 Intellectual Property is unnecessary. Now a new model exists.

	p If a system can be invented that has all the benefits of an old system and none if its downsides, its easy to say that the old system should be abandoned in favor of the new one.

	p We believe Crowdsell is such a system:

	p
		b All the Benefits:

		ul
			li
				i Rewards creators for valuable intellectual labor?
				| Check.
			li
				i Requires creators to share their insights with the world?
				| Check. This is a basic assumption of the Crowdsell model, that the compensation is only in return for open culture access.
			li
				i Protects creators from theft and plagiarism?
				| Check. If a creator has had some insight they need to keep secret before they are compensated, the system of previews and promises allows them to show only the unsensitive portion of their work and make statements about why it is useful. This protects both them and the backers. And in the event that there isn't some secret but they're worried about not receiving due credit when the idea is discussed in the future, the
				out-link(href="") creative commons attribution requirement
				| protects them as well. Those creative commons licenses do rely on existing copyright law to be effective, but even in a world without copyright law, a concept of
				router-link(to="/authorship-not-ownership") authorship rather than ownership
				| could protect their rights with a much lighter legal framework.

		b None of the Problems:

		ul
			li
				i Prevents Access?

			li
				i Possible to Manipulate?

				p Since we've removed coercion from the process, we can instead rely on much simpler and more justifiable rights, like the rights to not be assaulted or stolen from (no one is allowed to hack us to get the information), and the right not to be defrauded (no one can lie and say they created something when in fact someone else did)

				p Removing the coercion removes the ability for people who add no value to society but do deeply understand the legal machinery to profit. Since crowdsell lets the world decide, and makes the process free and open, these coercive systems can't be gamed.

			li
				i Favors the Rich and Powerful?

			li
				i Slows Innovation and Progress?

			li
				i Encourages Litigation?
				| One of the most encouraging things about this idea is that
				i multiple different creators can benefit from the same idea
				| . Since each of them merely has to have some distincitive contribution to make, and ask for an amount the world thinks is worthwhile, all of them can have success, it's just up to the world to decide.


			li
				i Encourages Walling of the Commons?

	h3 On the Subject of "Lottery Ticket" inventions.

	p Creators should set their reward amounts higher than they probably think

	p
		| The real problem with the lottery ticket effect is that
		i it was created by the patent system, and isn't a natural effect
		| . Essentially lottery tickets are the result of a coercive system that allows companies to extort the world for access to important technology. That's actually one of the problems this idea solves. Creators can still become wealthy, but not "obscenely" wealthy. And it's important to point out that the people getting obscenely wealthy were actually rarely the creators themselves, but the executives and capital owners who didn't add any real value to the process, but merely had the shrewdness to acquire the right patents at the right times, often by buying other companies. Once they had exercised this legal shrewdness (which relied more heavily on existing access to resources and positioning rather than actual cleverness), they had acquired a legal right to coerce people, that didn't have any relationship to the difficulty of producing the work.

	p Crowdsell brings the price of innovation back into the realm of reasonable markets. In the current system, companies can charge whatever is most profitable for them, rather than whatever is profitable based on market conditions. Since it's a coercive system, whoever gets to the patents first and has the legal firepower to defend them can charge literally any price they want, without any regard for what a market would say.


	p One of the things that mitigates this is that patentability requirements aren't important anymore. That means that
		i any
		| useful work you can contribute to the world can be rewarded. That means that some individual idea doesn't have to carry you into wealth, but rather many improvements and further applications of the same idea over time can have the same effect.
